2. ffmpeg -i "hdr_file_name.mp4" -c:v copy -an -vbsf hevc_mp4toannexb -f hevc hdr.hevc

3. dovi_tool inject-rpu -i "hdr.hevc" --rpu-in RPU.bin -o output.hevc


Next Command is used for Muxing Videos, Audios, Subtitles with Video. You can simply skip it (if you have allergy with command line) and Mux manually using mkvnixtool or tsmuxer.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Else, if you like command line or you need it, just mention needed files in the end of the command so that you can merge everything like boom.üßë‚ÄçüöÄ



1. mkvmerge -o "final_out.mkv" "output.hevc" "audio.mp4"


üö´ Warning : Check FPS , Runtimes or any fixes needed or not in output hevc file. These commands wont sync BD and WEB-DL videos. So, do that on your way...
